# Assignment3 
# Very First HTTP Server
#
# Created a HTTP Web Server that accepts only HTTP GET requests from the client.
# The request URL will contain the filename of the requested image . The HTTP server read the image file from the disk (from a standard directory "/Images") and then return that image.
# If a bad filename has been provided by the client in the request, then HTTP server returns 400 error message to the client.
